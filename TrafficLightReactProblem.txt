Traffic Light Component in React !

Requirements:
- Use React to create a component called TrafficLight.
- The TrafficLight component should display three lights: red, yellow, and green.
- The lights should switch according to the provided intervals:
  - Red light: 4000ms
  - Yellow light: 500ms
  - Green light: 3000ms

- The traffic light should loop indefinitely, switching between colors in the specified order.
- Ensure that only one light is active at a time.
- Style the traffic light to make it visually appealing.

Example Behaviour:
- Initially, the red light should be active.
- After 4000ms, the red light turns off, and the green light turns on.
- After 3000ms, the green light turns off, and the yellow light turns on.
- After 500ms, the yellow light turns off, and the red light turns on.

This sequence repeats indefinitely.
